# Preprocessing 3D Volumes for Tumor Segmentation using PyTorch and Monai

## Introduction 
Regarding the difficulties that we can encounter when using traditional image processing tools, deep learning has emerged as the primary solution in the healthcare field.

Because medical images are more difficult to process than standard images (dense contrast, a wide range of variations in the human bodyâ€¦) Deep learning is used for classification, object detection, and especially segmentation tasks.

When it comes to segmentation, deep learning is used to segment human organs such as the liver, lung, andâ€¦ or to segment tumors from different parts of the body.

## Tools we will use
To complete this task, we will use an open source framework called `monai`, which is based on `PyTorch`, which I used during my internship and found to be very useful.

## Little explanation
When using `monai`, you don't need to create any 2D images because it uses directly the 3D volumes. Here is the example of opening a 3D volume then convert it into a torch tensor:

```Python
orig_transforms = Compose(

    [
        LoadImaged(keys=['image', 'label']),
        AddChanneld(keys=['image', 'label']),
        
        ToTensord(keys=['image', 'label'])
    ]
)
```
